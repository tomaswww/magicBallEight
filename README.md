# magicBallEight

## Introduction

magicBallEight or most commonly known as magicEightBall it's based on the classical 8-Ball which attempts to predict answer to questions you have.

## Objective

This project is purely experimental and for learning purposes.
The ultimate goal of this program is for me to develop and practice my programing skills.

## Documentation

There's no need for documentation for this project. The intended purpose was to base this game on purely HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT, it requires [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) to handle animations.

## Usability

All game components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers without any installation required.
You need to download de repository, open the index.html file on your browser and.. voila! you'll have to ask a question and when you are ready click on the Shake and Bake! button for the magic answer (for more info check github repo for [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)).
